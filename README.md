### Data Hiding
Outside person can't access our internal data directly or our internal data should not go out directly.This OOP feature is nothing but data hiding.
After validation or identification outisde person can access internal data
Ex 1: After providing proper username and password we can able to access gmail inbox information.
Ex 2: Even though we are valid customers of the bank our account information but we can't access other account information.

By declaring data member(variable) as private we can achieve data hiding
